# HTML and CSS About Me Project
This HTML and CSS project creates a personal "About Me" webpage. It uses basic HTML structure, including headings, paragraphs, 
and lists to introduce me. The page incorporates inline styling for font size, color, and alignment, and external CSS is
linked for additional styling. It includes an unordered list for favorite classes, a table for favorite organizations with clickable links, 
and an image that links to myf email. The project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML elements, styling, and linking external resources.
