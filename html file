    <!-- About me, my major, and why I chose it! Also about where I worked and my dream job! -->

    <p>My name is Tanmayi Kurra and I am a freshman at NCSU! I wasn't sure about what to major in at first, but <i>Statistics</i> has always been my favorite
      class in high school and my teacher made it very interesting. I also really like the Statistics program at
      NCSU and thought it would be the perfect major for me. I like how there are many coding classes in the major, and
      still have a variaty of theoretical Statistics classes.
    </p>    

    <p style = "font-size:20px; font-family: sans-serif; color:ffffff; text-align:center;"> I have worked in <b>Tropical Smoothie Cafe</b> for a couple months my senior year in highschool and as a basketball
      score keeper for Town of Cary in 9th grade. My dream job would be a <u>data analyst or a data scientist</u>. I think it
      is very intersting to work with data after taking an intro to R and Python class here at NCSU and I found it interesting
      how data can be visualized with code or how we can use statistical methods when coding. I do not have a job right now though.
